        <p class="s">Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe. Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding. Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals.One of the basic benefits of planting trees is that they provide the life-giving oxygen and absorb carbon-dioxide exhaled by animals. However, not just oxygen trees also provide us fruits, wood, fibre, rubber and much more. Trees also serve as shelter for animals and birds.</p>
